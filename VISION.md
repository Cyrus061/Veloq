# Veloq – What I’m Building

Veloq is a simple idea: improve bike-sharing logistics by using real-time data and small rewards to move bikes from overcrowded stations to empty ones.

Today, cities spend a lot of money rebalancing bike fleets with trucks and staff.  
At the same time, there are people who could help if there were tools that coordinated this efficiently and fairly.

## Goals

- Help cities reduce operational costs without compromising service
- Improve user experience by reducing station imbalances
- Create new earning opportunities for individuals through small, local tasks
- Start with fiat payments to test the model quickly and simply

This isn’t about decentralization for its own sake. It’s about building a system that works and scaling it with the right infrastructure when the time comes.

## Looking Ahead

Once the concept is proven, Veloq will explore using stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure to:
- Automate task assignment, validation, and rewards
- Improve transparency and reduce payout friction
- Potentially integrate with DePIN-compatible Layer 1s for long-term scalability

Any Web3 elements will be added only if they improve efficiency, automation, or transparency.

## Roadmap Outline

- **V1**: Montreal pilot using Bixi API data → real-time imbalance map → manual payouts via fiat (e.g., Interac, PayPal)
- **V2**: Add basic automation, GPS validation, stablecoin integration
- **V3**: Expand to other cities and vehicles (e-scooters, cargo bikes), explore DAO-style coordination if the community grows

The project is early, but the problem is real. If this system saves cities money while creating meaningful local income, that’s a win.
