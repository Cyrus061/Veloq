# Veloq – Decentralizing Urban Bike Rebalancing

### About the Project

Bike-sharing systems are great, until you get to a station with no bikes or no empty docks.  
Cities spend a lot of money moving bikes around with trucks and staff just to fix this.

**Veloq** is a simple idea:  
Let the community help fix the imbalance and get rewarded for it.

We're building a protocol that pays people in stablecoins to move bikes from overcrowded stations to empty ones.  
Everything will be automated through open data, smart contracts, and real-time task rewards.

### How It Works

1. A station is either full or empty we detect it through open APIs.
2. A small reward is offered to anyone who can move a bike from point A to point B.
3. A rider (or micro-worker) accepts the task and completes it.
4. GPS + dock data confirms it → stablecoin reward is sent automatically.

### Why This Matters

- Bike-share systems improve when bikes are where people need them.
- Cities save money on logistics and improve service uptime.
- Local riders and micro-entrepreneurs can earn directly by helping rebalance their neighborhoods.
- It's a small step toward making smart cities more open, fair, and people-powered.

### What I’m Working On

- Starting with Bixi (Montreal), using their open station data as a first test case.
- Exploring simple tools to visualize where bikes and docks are imbalanced across the network.
- Laying the groundwork for a future protocol that could issue tasks and stablecoin rewards to riders or rebalancers.

### Who I’m Looking For

Right now this is a solo project at the early idea stage.  
If you’re curious about urban mobility, bike-sharing, or tokenized incentives, I’d love to connect.

I’m especially interested in:
- Developers who know how to work with APIs or open city data
- People who’ve built on Peaq, DePIN, or similar infrastructure
- Anyone who’s worked with shared mobility systems

This is still early, but if it clicks with you, it could be something meaningful.

### Token & Incentives

For now, rewards will be paid in **stablecoins** (e.g., USDC).  
No volatile token stuff, just real-world rewards for real-world effort.

Veloq is early, but the need is real.  
This is step one. If you're into smarter cities and helping people earn through meaningful, local work. Welcome!
